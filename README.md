# STM32_LEDandKEY

This is an example using the TM1638 based LED&Key display with a STM32F767 Nucleo-144 development board. There are librarys that exist for Arduino that work with this board, for example the [TM1638plus](https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/TM1638plus). That provided a refernce for this example for use in STM32CubeIDE.
